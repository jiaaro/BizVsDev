Friday the 13<sup>[th](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th_(franchise))</sup>: It was a [dark and stormy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Clifford) night; another [rainy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MsoOWVNOio&feature=kp) day in New York City…

Mik has another one..but he can't find it for now.

- The word, “Dethrone”, doesn’t translate from Russian (eviscerate). [This article](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/uc/2014/06/can_language_influence_our_perception_of_reality.html#!/) on language and perception of reality wasn't what Mik referenced, but it illustrates a vital point in language and the mental concepts presented/encompassed therein. While trying to remember the Russian word (that Mik almost positively remembered while recording), he figured [this piece](http://arstechnica.com/science/2007/05/language-influences-color-perception/) on Russian language speakers and their uncanny ability to distinguish between different shades of blue (relative to English speakers, for instance) is also relevant to a discussion on what gets lost in translation.
- [Dead Poets Society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6xyHna-NuM) video on the use of the word “interesting”. Except not really. Mik misremembered this two-fold. The scene he had in mind discussed usage of the word "very"..and this particular scene had nothing to do with "very". It was really his 8th grade English teacher that instilled his anti-"interesting" values. [Here's the quote he really had in mind](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/05/03/b3/0503b314af3a109a114bbcdbe51ad899.jpg)
