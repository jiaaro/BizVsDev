Clarification: When I (James) said the Yahoo News Digest push notification times are based on your phone’s location, I meant it's Time zone. 8AM and 6PM of your current time zone. The app doesn't know where you live and where you work. At least I don't think it does =P

Also, I was wrong that you can't see the past news. You can, but the UI doesn't promote it at all. The “unread” count only applies to the current batch of 10 news items. And no badge with a number of unread articles.
