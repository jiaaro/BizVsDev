**Note from Mik**: I made a mistake — the intro was by Daniel Goleman. Paul Ekman is of emotion and facial expression fame, and his book, [Emotions Revealed: Recognizing Faces and Feelings to Improve Communication and Emotional Life](http://www.amazon.com/Emotions-Revealed-Second-Recognizing-Communication/dp/0805083391/ref=la_B002FSXSVI_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1398306958&sr=1-1) is also _highly_ recommended.
