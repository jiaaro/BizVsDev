### James’ Thoughts on Apple Wearables

There are some arguments floating around which I'll sum up here:

- A wearable product could not sell at the same volume as the iPhone, even at a sub $200 price point
- A sub $200 product selling in significantly lower volume than the iPhone/iPad will not move the needle for apple
- The iPhone is so profitable for Apple at least in part because of Carrier subsidies, which is a market distortion they will not be able to reproduce elsewhere.

These arguments, combined with the slew of new types of data we see in the [Healthbook leaks][healthbook], and Apple's previously stated [interest in medical devices](http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/16/5416850/apple-medical-devices) gave me an idea:

What if Apple *could* reproduce the market distortion they have with iPhone? Health insurance companies give their customers a break if they go to the gym, and they cover preventative care. It makes business sense.

Would Health insurance companies cover wearables that provide detailed health tracking?

My take: If there’s a company that could make it happen, It's Apple.
