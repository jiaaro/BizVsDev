- [Nitinol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_titanium)

> Nitinol is in fact thermodynamic nickel–titanium, which is used as orthodontic wire. It was developed in the 1960s for the space program at the Naval Ordnance lab in Silver Springs. Can't find anything about it being tested as something for injured veterans. Perhaps my orthodontist was privy to some insider knowledge--or was pulling my leg (better alternative to my teeth) [[source](http://endoexperience.com/documents/Anoverviewofnickeltitaniumalloysused.pdf)]
