- [Nitinol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_titanium)

> Nitinol is, in fact, thermodynamic nickel–titanium, which is used as orthodontic wire. Maddy and Mik were referring to the same metal! It was developed in the 1960s for the space program at the Naval Ordnance lab in Silver Springs. Can’t find anything about it being tested as something for injured veterans. But the timing lines up a bit..Perhaps Mik's orthodontist was privy to some insider knowledge–or was pulling his leg (better alternative to his teeth) [[source](http://endoexperience.com/documents/Anoverviewofnickeltitaniumalloysused.pdf)]
